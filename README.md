Mount and Triforce: Hyrule Bannerlord

The goal is to have the recreation of the Fan Games, Hyrule Conquest and Hyrule Total War, created by Undying Nephalim.

This mod is still in it's infancy, even though it has been a few years. I recently got back into learning how to mod Bannerlord and instead of actually posting this on Steam, I am placing it here.

Installation.

Download the file by pressing the "code" button, which drops down some options. Download the zip.

Go into where your game is at. Steam users can right-click on their bannerlord game, which has a top down to "manage" and "Browse Local Files". Then head to Modules.
Else you have to go where your steam files are. Usually in this directory. "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Mount & Blade II Bannerlord\Modules".

Once there, open your Zip file and take the "Hyrule_Bannerlord-main" and move it in your "Modules" folder. Rename the file to "Hyrule_Bannerlord" and you are good.

So far.

The Hylian Melee weapons are avaliable. (Again.)

They are not ballanced to the base game.
